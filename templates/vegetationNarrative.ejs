  <p>The trees are growing up, falling down, or burning up.  Lakes have more vegetation in them or drying up altogether which then leads to shrubification.  Observers noted a variety of changes in vegetation that have affected their travel and access.  Thicker brush on trails makes it more difficult to travel and requires more trail maintenance. Brush in some cases have expanded into airstrips making them no longer usable. Lakes are getting more vegetation making the use of outboard motors difficult. In some cases lakes are drying up altogether changing both the travel methods in that area and the fish, birds, or wildlife that might have otherwise been harvested there.</p>
  <p>Fire changes the landscape rapidly.  Trails can be significantly obstructed and be difficult to find following forest fires. Accessing a trail for the first time after a fire requires a prodigious use of a chain saw. Even after the initial clearing of a trail, trees will continue to fall for years after a forest fire requiring continual maintenance of a trail afterwards.  Fire also changes what vegetation and animals would have been there previously.  Forest fires are part of the natural cycle of boreal forest and can improve harvest opportunities such as berry picking and moose habitat in coming years. However, in some cases increasing fire frequency and intensity may offset some of these long-term benefits.</p>
