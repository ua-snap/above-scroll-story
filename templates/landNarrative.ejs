  <p>Trails along river banks, through the boreal forest, and wetlands are used in the summer and winter. As many trails cross lakes and wetlands, the use of trails become more limited in summer by the increased presence of water although they still provide important corridors for accessing resources.  Optimal trail conditions in winter are a consistent grade with dependably frozen ground. In summer, optimal trail conditions are a consistent grade, dry, and not obstructed.</p>
  <p>Trails are being affected by environmental changes in several ways.  Rivers and roads that are located in close proximity to river banks are increasingly being damaged or completely destroyed by river bank erosion.  On land, unseasonably wet conditions quickly deteriorate trails and sometimes make trails impassible.  Observers reported seeing more sinkholes as they traversed the landscape. In the summer, these holes fill with water, sometimes cutting off trail access. In winter, these sinkholes create conditions that are easy to get stuck in and are difficult to navigate through.  Whether using trails in summer or winter all of these environmental changes has made for slower and more uncertain travel conditions.</p>
