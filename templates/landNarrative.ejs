  <h2>Observers explain EROSION, SEDIMENTATION, AND WATER LEVEL conditions that affect LAND travel and access</h2>
  <p>Trails along riverbanks, through the boreal forest, and across wetlands are used year-round. Trail access across lakes and wetlands is limited in summer by the increased presence of water, although trails still provide important corridors for accessing resources. Optimal trail conditions in winter include a consistent grade with dependably frozen ground. Optimal summer trail conditions are dry and unobstructed.</p>
  <p>Trails are affected by environmental changes in several ways. Trails and roads that are located close to riverbanks and lakes are increasingly being damaged or completely destroyed by bank erosion. Banks are steeper, making it more difficult to get to old portages. On land, unseasonably wet conditions quickly deteriorate trails and sometimes make them impassible. Observers reported seeing more sinkholes as they traversed the landscape, which are likely related to thawing permafrost. In the summer, these holes fill with water, sometimes cutting off trail access. In winter, sinkholes create conditions that are easy to get stuck in and are difficult to navigate through.  All of these environmental changes have made for slower and more uncertain travel conditions throughout the year.</p>
