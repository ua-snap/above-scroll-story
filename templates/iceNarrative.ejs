  <h2>Ice conditions</h2>
<p>Rivers and lakes have always been efficient &ldquo;highways&rdquo; for snowmachine and dogsled travel. Thick, stable, and predictable ice meant safe and reliable winter travel. Increasingly, this is not what is being experienced by people.</p>
<p>Observers reported rivers and lakes freezing later and thawing earlier than what they experienced in the past. Also, thin ice and open water are becoming more common in midwinter and restricting access to otherwise well used travel routes. Open holes and thin ice throughout winter make for extremely dangerous conditions that have claimed lives. More frequent overflow on river ice slows or reroutes travel. More frequent occurrences of shelf ice forming along riverbanks can pose obstacles to snowmachine routes all winter long.</p>

        <span class="citation__summary">Explores changes in timing of river ice freeze-up and break-up through community observations and remote sensing. Analysis found that the timing of freeze-up was closely related to seasonal air temperatures. <strong>Break-up has advanced by about 6 days over the last century, and some communities observed delays in freeze-up of 1-2 days/decade. Unsafe travel conditions were 2 to 3 times greater during freeze-up than during break-up.</strong></span>
