  <p>Rivers in Interior Alaska have always provided critical travel corridors to its residents.  Once the river ice thaws, snow machines are replaced with boats.  Rivers like the Yukon, Tanana, Kuskokwim, and Chandalar for Interior Alaska residents are the equivalent to the I-405 for Californians.  These rivers have always undergone seasonal changes that influence their navigability. Consistent seasonal change provides a degree of predictability that helps boat travellers navigate them safely.</p>
  <p>During the year of documentation, observers cited a combination of environmental conditions that made travel and access to hunting, fishing, and gathering resources more difficult.  Among notable changes were unseasonably high and low water levels as well as rapid bank erosion.  This makes boat travel in rivers more dangerous with increased amounts of debris in the water. It also can quickly change otherwise well established river channels.  The sediment load in rivers is increasing, making some rivers shallower and more difficult to navigate.  Unseasonably low water levels combined with shallower rivers</p>
  <p>In addition to safety, these changes impact fishing in several ways. Fishing locations that have been reliable in the past are no longer a sure bet, people have to find new spots to fish. Fishing nets or fish wheels are also more quickly filled with debris. Unseasonably high water in September, an important time for moose hunting, can both help and hinder hunting.  High water on main rivers covers riverbanks where moose might otherwise be, but it will also fill small tributaries and in some cases improve hunting access.</p>
