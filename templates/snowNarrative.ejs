  <h2>Snow conditions</h2>
  <p>Observers describe that in the past temperatures would drop in September. By October, snow would begin to accumulate and remain all winter. Consistent drops in temperature and dependable snow accumulation provide optimal winter travel conditions by snowmachine and dogsled.</p>
  <p>Recently, delayed and more variable seasonal snow accumulation, as well as precipitation in the form of rain during winter, are making winter travel harder and unpredictable. Rain-on-snow (icing) events are more common, and leave the snowpack crusty, thinner, and hard. Trails are much rougher, can be difficult to traverse, and are hard on sled suspensions and dog feet. It&rsquo;s much easier to get stuck on brush and overheat snowmachines that need a deep, soft snowpack to cool engines. With these changing conditions there is more use of four-wheelers during what had been the winter travel season in the past.</p>
